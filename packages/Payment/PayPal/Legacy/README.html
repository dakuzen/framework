<h2>
			Providing Proxy Support</h2>
		<P>Right now, if the user is behind proxy,unable to make a API call to PayPal.
		<p>"SDKProxyProperties.php"(&lt;installation directory&gt;/php-sdk/lib/PayPal/) is the configuration file for Proxy setup.</p>
		<p>Update the following variables in "SDKProxyProperties.php" for Proxy configuration.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>USE_PROXY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Set this variable to TRUE to route all the API requests through Proxy(by default it is FALSE).</a></li>
			<li>PROXY_HOST - Set this variable to Proxy Server name or IP address </a></li>
			<li>PROXY_PORT - Set this variable to Proxy Server port </a></li>
			<li>PROXY_USER - Set this variable to Proxy Server user id (optional) </a></li>
			<li>PROXY_PASSWORD - Set this variable to Proxy Server password (optional) </a></li>
		</ul>
		
			<h3>NOTE:</h3>
			<p>Since PHP does not support "-" in variable names,sdk WSDL proxy generator will replace it by "_".<br>Before sending the xml request string, "_" has to be replaced by "-" back and this will be done by '/PayPal/SOAP/PatternReplace.php' which is called in '/PayPal/SOAP/client.php'.
			Uncomment the line in client.php if any wsdl tag element with "-" is in use(like "cpp_header_image")</p>
			<h2>LICENSING</h2>
		<p>Read the "LICENSE.txt" file for important legal information regarding the PayPal
			SDK.</p>
